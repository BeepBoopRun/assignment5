#### My example repository

## What I learned about git:

- It is a very useful tool for version control, basically indespensible for projects requiring collaboration with others.

- Making branches is really useful for one-off analyses, especially if we plan to break the data format in the future.

- Git log can be used to track project project's progression through time, which can be useful to find breaking changes in previous versions.
