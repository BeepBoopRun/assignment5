### My example repository

## What I learned about git:

- It is a very useful tool for version control and basically indespensible for projects requiring collaboration with others.

- Making branches is really useful for one-off analyses, especially if we plan to break the data format in the future.

- **Git log** can be used to track project's progression through time, which can be useful to find important changes in previous versions.

- Commits should alawys have identifiable messages, to make understandable at a glance.

- One has to keep in mind to always commit when working on a project from different devices, as not doing so can result in a merge conflict.

- **Git blame** can be used to traceback unwated changes back to their author.

- **Git diff** can be useful when using format tools, to see what changes they make.
